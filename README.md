# Introduction

Cmdlets for [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)

## Status

I have only just started with the work on this module. Therefore, it is currently lacking...

- Separation of functions into files

- Standardized `Invoke-HetznerCloudApi` cmdlet

- Pagination

- Creation of objects (except for SSH keys)

- Modification of objects

- Error handling

- Unit tests

- Checking rate limit information

This repo is still missing the Appveyor pipeline for building and publishing.
